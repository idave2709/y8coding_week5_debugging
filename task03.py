name = input("What is your name?") ### made by me

if name == "Bob":
    print("Who are you Bob?")
else:
    print("Welcome to the debugging lesson!")


### What was wrong ?
### DISCUSS HERE:
###
### Was this a... syntax, logical or runtime error?

### this is a syntax error as the first print isnt tabbed and not indented into the if. and also there is another logical error as the varibale 'name' isnt defined yet
