old = input("How old are you?")

print("Nice to know you are", old, "years old!")


### What was wrong ?
### DISCUSS HERE:
###
### Was this a... syntax, logical or runtime error?

### it is logical because the varible name stated is age and the person wrote 'old' in the 3rd line when they were running the print command
